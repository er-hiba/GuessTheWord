## Description
This is a text-based word guessing game where the player's objective is to correctly guess the letters in a word. The player starts by inputting a word at the beginning of the game, and this word is then concealed by asterisks. The game enforces specific criteria for the word input, ensuring that it falls within the range of 4 to 25 characters and contains only uppercase letters. The player is given a maximum of 5 incorrect attempts to reveal the hidden word by guessing the correct letters. The player enters individual letters to uncover the concealed word. If a correct letter is entered, it is revealed in the corresponding positions in the word. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the entire word or exhausts their 5 incorrect attempts. The player receives feedback at the end, indicating whether they successfully guessed the concealed word or not.
